Think I might be suitable for something you need?

I'd be delighted to **talk** or **write** for you on any of the areas covered on this site, or other reasonable topics.  

I am available for **consultancy work**.

I have a strong background in leading and contributing to project-based work, from inception through to implementation.

My particular strengths include (but are not limited to!)
* being the interpreter between those with the requirements for a system and those with the tech skills to build that system
* being able to determine and write policies and procedural documentation that makes sense for those needing them
* being able to explain the risks and best ways to go about digital technology use in your organisation, given the particular nuances of what you do

I have experience of working in and alongside many types of organisations, from multi-national corporates to intergovermental organisations, charities to academic institutions and more.

Get in touch and I can give you further details about my background and suitability for your project.
