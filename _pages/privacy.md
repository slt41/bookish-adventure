Thanks for coming to find out about me!

If you want me to find out about you, you'll have to [contact](/contact/) me, because I don't use cookies or any other analytics on this site - I'm not trying to sell you anything, and the last thing I need is more data to analyse :rofl:

I host this website through Github. You might want to check out their [privacy policies](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement).
