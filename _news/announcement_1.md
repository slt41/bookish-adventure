:sparkles: PETRAS has published the [Living with Hearing Loss in a Connected Home - White Paper](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10096344/). :sparkles:


The result of a survey and stakeholder workshop, the paper details challenges facing people with hearing loss in engagement with connected technologies and identifies priority areas for technology intervention and development.

The workshop was organised by the PETRAS National Centre of Excellence for IoT Systems Cybersecurity. It was attended by representatives from technology companies and various UK groups for people with hearing loss (both profoundly deaf and hard-of-hearing, as well as cochlear implant users), some individual end-users with various types of hearing loss, and researchers.
