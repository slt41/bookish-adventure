“Approaches and Technologies to Support Home Users’ Engagement with Cyber Security” analyses the way in which UK families engage with cyber security when using home Internet of Things (IoT) devices. By determining the prevalence of devices in the home, how different family members use those devices, and what knowledge of cyber security those individuals have, it aims to expose specific needs in the improvement of device design, marketing or support; more targeted governmental policy, or regulation, where devices are used by both adults and children; and how best to address the need for further education, both for adults and children.
