This page is little different to the other projects I've listed on this site.

Since becoming a mother I have taken a great interest in (and devoted a *lot* of time to) helping new parents get to grips with how to feed and bond with their new babies. I currently support families throughout the UK over the [National Breastfeeding Helpline](https://www.nationalbreastfeedinghelpline.org.uk/){:target="\_blank"}, and am a director of one of the UK's main breastfeeding charities, the [Breastfeeding Network](https://www.breastfeedingnetwork.org.uk/){:target="\_blank"}. For the avoidance of doubt, both of these roles are unpaid.

New parenthood is something that is, perhaps weirdly at first, all too ripe for technological intervention. A complex and emotive topic at the best of times, I spent some time during my studies at [UCL STEaPP](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/steapp/){:target="\_blank"} considering both how current government policies set up new families very poorly to be as self-sufficient as they are expected (and expecting) to be, and also the benefits - and (more prominently) issues - of app-based parental support. In time, I will rework those pieces and they'll find their way on here!
