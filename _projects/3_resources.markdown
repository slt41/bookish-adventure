This is a living list of resources that I consider to be useful for getting started thinking about cyber security and digital technology use and management, if you're based in the UK.

If you think I am missing anything [drop me a line](mailto:slt41@kent.ac.uk), so I can add the resources and credit them to you!

Full list is published as a PDF [here](/assets/pdf/resources.pdf).

The guidance is based heavily upon getting its readers to consider their own threat model (that is, what do they have that needs to be protected, and who might want that information/data/whatever it is that is determined to be valuable).
