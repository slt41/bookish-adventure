My PhD project is looking at how families use the IoT devices that they have in their home.

In particular, I am keen to understand

* whether all family members use devices in the same way
* why family members buy them
* where they learn about how to use and keep their devices safe

Interested in helping? We will be running a survey and interviews for families with at least one IoT device in the home during the summer of 2020.  

If you live in the UK and are interested in participating, [e-mail](mailto:slt41@kent.ac.uk) me.

Alternatively, sign up to our [mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/28b73f23d996/families-and-iot){:target="\_blank"} here. It will provide updates on both the project and what is going on in the world of IoT, cyber security and the home.
